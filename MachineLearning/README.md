# 22-23 November: A CRASH COURSE ON USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS EFFECTIVELY IN PRACTICE

## COURSE OUTLINE   
-        An overview of the basic problems of machine learning (ML)
-        Supervised, unsupervised learning
-        Classification/regression techniques
-        A demonstration of basic classifiers. Performance measures such as accuracy, recall, and precision, F1-score.
-        Differences between ML approaches and statistics approaches to problem solving.
-        Train, Dev/Validate, Test/Production sets, K-fold cross validation.
-        Hyper-Parameters.
-        Bias-variance tradeoff.
-        Taste of unsupervised learning
-        K-means, image segmentation
-        PCA and SVD
-        Introduction to non-linear auto-encoder architecture
